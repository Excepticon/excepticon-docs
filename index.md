# Excepticon Documentation
[Excepticon](https://excepticon.io) is an exception monitoring service for .NET applications and services that gives developers the information that they need to quickly detect, troubleshoot, and fix bugs in their production applications and services.

Excepticon is easy to configure and simple to use.  This documentation will help get you up and running in minutes.



### Quick Start

Hit the ground running with the [Getting Started](articles/getting-started/index.md) guide.  You'll be monitoring exceptions faster than you can remember how to write that LINQ query with the left outer join **and** the group by.



### Further Reading

Once your app is configured, feel free to peruse the other documentation.  The [Excepticon Web Application](web-application/index.md) articles will take you on a tour of the features in the Excepticon web app.  

You can check out the [Client Libraries](libaries/index.html) to explore the classes and methods available in the Excepticon client packages.

Swing over to GitHub to see things in action.  There are several [example](https://github.com/Excepticon/excepticon-dotnet/tree/master/examples) projects that demonstrate how to configure Excepticon and log exceptions.  More will be added in the future.
