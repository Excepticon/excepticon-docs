# Excepticon Web Application

The [Excepticon web app](https://excepticon.io) is where you'll create and monitor your .NET applications and services.

There are a few main areas of the web app that we'll get familiar with:

* [Projects](projects.md) - Create and update projects, view project list.
* [Exceptions](exceptions.md) - Monitor and manage exceptions.
* [User Settings](user-settings.md) - Manage your user profile and account settings.
