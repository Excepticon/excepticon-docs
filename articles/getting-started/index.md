# Getting Started

Before installing any Nuget packages, head to the [web app](https://excepticon.io) and take care of a few prerequisites:

1. **Create Excepticon Account** - You'll need create an Excepticon account before you can use the Excepticon SDK. All of our [plans](https://excepticon.io/plans) include a free 15-day trial (no credit card required), and we offer a Developer plan that is free for solo developers working on non-commercial projects.
2. **Create Project** - After creating an account, create a project in the Excepticon web app.
3. **Get API Key** - An API key will be generated when your project is created and can be retrieved from the Project Settings page in Excepticon. This key uniquely identifies your project and will be used when configuring the SDK.

With that out of the way, you can proceed with configuring your application.  How you configure your project depends on the type of project you're building.

(Think of this as a "Choose Your Own Adventure," except you won't win a BOOK IT! pizza coupon by getting to the end.)

I want to add Excepticon to ...

- My ASP.NET Core application.  Go [here](asp-net-core.md).
- My .NET Core generic host.  Go [here](net-core-generic-host.md).
- My Azure Functions app.  Go [here](azure-functions.md).
- My console app.  Go [here](console.md).

Excepticon can be integrated into other types of .NET projects as well, and I'm working on getting those examples available.  Until then, the existing examples and client library documentation can offer some guidance in getting your project configured.

[Get in touch](mailto:jon@excepticon.io) with me if you'd like assistance configuring your project to use Excepticon.
